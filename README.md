# FitLife-Fitness-Tracker
FitLife Will be an Android application that anyone can sign up for.

FitLife is an all-encompassing app that will allow users to get the most from their fitness journey. With a heavy emphasis on the social aspect of fitness, we strive to encourage healthy competition between the users. Users will be able to get calorie counts and much more. With it being so hard to stick to our own fitness goals, we believe that having a friendly competition aspect within our app will encourage users to be more active. Workouts can be tracked within our app and this will be the deciding factor of who wins the competition or not. A ranking system will be in place so users can see if they are winning or if they are losing the competition.
